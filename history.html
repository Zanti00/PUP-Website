            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The <b>PUP Quezon City Campus,</b> formerly PUP Commonwealth Campus, is a 1.9-hectare forested land area and was assigned, transferred and endorsed to the <b>Polytechnic University of the Philippines</b> as ASSIGNEE by the <b>Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council-National Government Center Housing Committee (HUDCC-NGCHC),</b> a government entity created by Executive Order No. 90 and with expanded functions under RA 7279 and <b>Home Insurance And Guaranty Corporation (HIGC)</b> as Assignor, a government owned and controlled corporation created under RA 580 and presently located at Don Fabian Street, Barangay Commonwealth, Quezon City. Thru the concerted efforts of <b>Dr. Ofelia M. Carague, PUP Executive Vice President</b> and <b>Mr. Jaime E. Varela, Project Administrator, NGCHP,</b> a <b>Deed of Assignment</b> was executed and signed by <b>Atty. Dionisio C. Dela Serna, HUDCC-NGCHC Chairman, MR. Wilfredo F. Hernandez, HIGC President and DR. Zenaida A. Olonan, University President</b> on <b>24 March 1997</b> with a sole objective to <i>“establish a branch or an extension of PUP at the National Government Center with a mandate to bring quality education and subsidized tuition fees to the urban poor communities of Quezon City, with priority given to those from the NGCHP.”</i></p>
            <p>Prior to this, an execution of <b>Deed of Donation,</b> whereby two (2) halls - <b>Rothlehner and Misereor</b> Building today in honor to their generosity and benevolence as funding-donors in which the two buildings were built - were donated to PUP for its purposes entered into by and between the <b>Sentro sa Ikauunlad ng Kasanayan at Hanapbuhay (SIKHAY)</b> – an association duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) represented by its <b>President, Rev. Fr. Joel E. Tabora, S.J. and PUP</b> on 26 February 1997.</p>
            <p>Upon its opening in 1997 offering a Master in Educational Management under the Open University System, PUP Quezon City also offered Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and a 1-Year Certificate in Information Communication Technology on its first year of formal operations during the Academic Year 1998-1999. As part of the donated property, the two original structures known as Rothlehner and Misereor Halls today became integral parts of the campus and now served as classrooms, Learning Resource Center, and academic and administrative offices for students and faculty members.</p>
            <p>On <b>July 29, 1997,</b> PUP Quezon City was officially established during its formal launching on the very same grounds with the special presence of Mr. Rothlehner who himself was awarded the Plaque of Recognition by PUP President, Dr. Zenaida A. Olonan, together with other honored guests from the Local Government of Quezon City and PUP administration.</p>
            <p>At present, there are seven undergraduate program offerings, namely:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</li>
                <li>Bachelor in Business Teacher and Livelihood Education major in Home Economics and major in Information Communication Technology</li>
                <li>Bachelor of Science in Business Administration major in Marketing Management and Human Resource Management</li>
                <li>Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship and</li>
                <li>Bachelor of Public Administration with specialization in Fiscal Administration</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In addition, the campus also offers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Diploma in Office Management Technology with specialization in Medical Office Management.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>True to the university’s mandate as Pamantasan ng Bayan, its graduate degree thru the Open University education system increased by offering two additional programs including the first program offering as practical alternative venue from PUP Main Campus, namely:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Master in Educational Management</li>
                <li>Master in Information Technology</li>
                <li>Master in Public Administration</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The PUP Quezon City Campus presently has a total of four buildings which include the newly constructed Academic Building with 12 classrooms and another one that houses the Audio-Visual Room and Computer Laboratory. In addition, an Ecumenical Chapel that can be converted to a mini hall and the Winnie Castelo Welfare Complex, a covered court that cater to the nonacademic needs of the students.</p>
            <p>Considered as a miniature of the PUP Main Campus in its design, this <b>“Green Campus”</b> is a viable option for the Iskolar ng Bayan coming from northeast of Metro Manila and as far as Rizal and Bulacan as a haven for their search for knowledge. And to seal its official existence as an affirmation of the University’s commitment to democratize access to educational opportunities for economically challenged students of society, <b>Republic Act 11347,</b> otherwise known as the <b><i>“PUP Quezon City Campus Act”</i></b> was signed into law on <b>June 25, 2019.</b> This was made possible by the 17th Congress House Bill No. 7734 through the sponsorship of the 2nd District of Quezon City Representative, <b>Honorable Winston “Winnie” T. Castelo</b> in the House of Representatives as well as the Chair of Committee on Education, Arts and Culture, <b>Honorable Francis “Chiz” G. Escudero</b> from the Senate.</p>
            <p>Started as petitions to have a higher educational institution for the youth at the National Government Center area from the community organizations and church groups, namely; <b>Parokya ng Mabuting Pastol (PMP), Kaagapay sa Makatarungan at Pantay na Paninirahan, Inc. (KAMPI), SUPERBLOCKS, and Kristong Hari Foundation (KHF),</b> and negotiations with local officials and other government agencies, the <b>PUP Quezon City</b> is a pantheon of concrete success towards the struggle in people’s fight against ignorance. The campus will continue its passion and commitment to <i>“provide quality education to the urban poor communities of Quezon City and its neighboring localities.”</i></p>
